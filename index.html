          <h3>About Me</h3>
          <div class="about-info">
            <p>I'm from Milwaukee, Wisconsin, where I currently reside with my husband and our two cats. For the last 10 years, I've enjoyed a unique career as a Slot Compliance Technician at Potawatomi Hotel & Casino, near downtown Milwaukee. In 2019, I took a Udemy course through work to broaden my Microsoft Excel knowledge, when I discovered how much I enjoyed learning Visual Basic for Applications, or VBA. Learning to write code opened up a new world for me and I knew I wanted to explore other coding languages. Recently, I enrolled in Skillcrush's Break into Tech program.</p>

          <div class="about-info">
            <p>One week in, I had created my first one-page website and instantly, I knew I wanted a career change. Coding a website from scratch is an amazing feeling! I realized I had found something I truly loved that would allow me to continue learning, while giving me the freedom and versatility I was looking for in my work. Currently, I'm continuing to take courses in front-end and back-end development as well as UX/UI. I also plan to begin my search for a front end-development position where I can use my newly acquired capabilities, organizational skills and attention to detail to create captivating websites.</p>
